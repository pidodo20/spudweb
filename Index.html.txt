Hi, I am Paul Andrew S. Cruz. You can also call me Pido, Do, Dopi, Pidow, Dowpi, Odip, Kosa, Kapatid, Kuya. But my main circle of friends, family, always call me Pido, "Pido"  comes from my auntie's husband uncle Boy he called me "Pido" because of his favorite actor on Tagalog movies and that's the story behind the "Pido". My birthplace is in Angono Medics on February 20, 2006, I am the first born of my mother. And my hometown is Pantok Binangonan, Rizal, My hobbies are playing basketball, rapping, dancing, and buying and reselling thrifted clothes, what I love about being a thirfter? I make more friends, I make money and I improve my social life by being a thrifter. I am currently selling ice candy at school for me to have more income to pay my tuition. My current school is Raises Montessori Academe Pantok, the teachers in Raises are good to me and they give me moral life lessons when I'm down so shoutout to the teachers of Raises Montessori Academe Pantok Thank you always teachers! students in Raises know that they are valued and respected. </body>
